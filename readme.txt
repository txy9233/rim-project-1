Been very sick for the past week, and was counting on using the break to work on this.
Unfortuately, was bed ridden for all of the break, and am still very slowly recovering.

Again, I should not have done this, but I based code off an in class example.
I added code that would allow for a square ball to bounce off the paddles. 
I was unable to get that code working in time for prototype submission, so I ended up
commenting out/deleting all of it in frustration. 

This falls on me, I should have tried to start it a week earlier, so that I would have 
some buffer, but unfortunately, things happened both in and out of my control.
I aim to have something to show by next week more than just a retouched ICE. 
I am very disappointed in myself, but I know that if I keep ragging on 
myself like this, it will negatively impact my work in the long run.
